<h2>About Me</h2>
<body>
<p>My name is Kristian, I was born on the 29<sup>th</sup> of January 2003. I'm from a small island in the Caribbean called Grenada. I am really into music, I’ve been playing the drums for about 10 years and the guitar for 3 years, and right now I’m all about improving on guitar and music theory. Before I really got into music, I loved playing soccer in elementary school and basketball in highschool but I stopped because I found other hobbies I'm passionate about.

<p>I have two older brothers that have finished school. My eldest brother is a professional musician, so I kinda followed in his footsteps because when I watched him play It looked like so much fun. I also love to video edit, I’ve done a couple projects on my own videos, and some for my church</p>
